The engine also includes tons of different powerups, over a hundred different enemies, and much, much more!\r\n\r\n# Downloads\r\n * [Hello Mario Engine v6.1 Source (GMZ)](https://app.box.com/shared/ulhet40pn3) [(Mirror)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rfba556z62mr9ho/Hello%20Mario%20Engine%20Source%20v6.1.zip?dl=0)\r\n * [Hello Mario Engine v6.1 Preview (EXE)](https://app.box.com/shared/itgmp2c4no) [(Mirror)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/65g94pey0w7hgtv/Hello%20Mario%20Engine%20Preview%20v6.1.zip?dl=0)\r\n\r\nWARNING: Make sure your copy of GameMaker: Studio is up to date before importing. Otherwise, you will experience problems.\r\n\r\n# Other Downloads\r\n * [Hello Mario Engine Legacy (GMK)](https://app.box.com/s/xhgy87zzqtzwuglj3ry3tozp0lioi3yu)\r\n\r\nThe legacy version is inferior to the main version, and requires the paid version of GameMaker 8.x. If you want the optimal Hello Mario Engine experience, or a version that can be used for free, use the main version instead.\r\n\r\n# Overview\r\n<object type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" style=\"width:450px; height:255px;\" data=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/eXweAawarDw\"></object>\r\n\r\n# Showcase\r\nHere are some examples of games that make use of this engine:\r\n * [Super Mario Dynamo](http://gamejolt.com/games/platformer/super-mario-dynamo/37100/)\r\n * [Super Mario Eclipse](http://gamejolt.com/games/platformer/super-mario-eclipse/19591/)\r\n * [Super Mario Bros: Ztar Turmoil](http://gamejolt.com/games/shooter/super-mario-bros-ztar-turmoil/10586/)\r\n\r\n# Issues\r\nPlease post all bug reports and suggestions in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/HelloFangaming/HelloMarioEngine/issues). Do not post feature requests.\r\n\r\n# Code Repository\r\n[Click here](https://github.com/HelloFangaming/HelloMarioEngine) to view this project's repository. You can use it to download the latest version of the Hello Mario Engine source code. If you just want the latest stable version, you can use the download link above instead.\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\nOne very common question about this engine is how to use the GMZ source file. Here are step by step instructions:\r\n * Download a copy of [GameMaker: Studio](http://www.yoyogames.com/studio), and a copy of the Hello Mario Engine Source above.\r\n * If you haven't already done so, upgrade your copy of Studio to the Standard version. This requires that you fill in your email address from within the program, and then, input the license key that you receive in order to upgrade your copy of Studio for free. Optionally, you can purchase the Professional or Master Collection versions of the software, but you don't need those to use the Hello Mario Engine.\r\n * Once you have your upgraded copy of Studio, after you start it up, you will see an import tab. Click on it, and import the HelloMarioEngine.gmz file that you downloaded.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
